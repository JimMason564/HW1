#01- Refractoring homework

This repository contains the homework for Unit 1. This assignment came with a website that was already coded and styled but not semantically or accessibility correct. I have worked through the site, adding the semantically correct containers and cleaning up the code to make it easier to read. I have further added alt descriptions to all images to ease accessibility concerns
