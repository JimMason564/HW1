#01- Refractoring homework

This repository contains the homework for Unit 1. This assignment came with a website that was already coded and styled but not semantically or accessibility correct. I have worked through the site, adding the semantically correct containers and cleaning up the code to make it easier to read. I have further added alt descriptions to all images to ease accessibility concerns

I also cleaned up the CSS file by consolidating based on container instead of having a class for each styling piece. This made both files easier to read and understand. I then reordered the elements in the CSS file as they were not in the same order as the HTML file.
